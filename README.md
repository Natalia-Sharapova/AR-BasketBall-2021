# AR-BasketBall-2021

Hello! 
This is my first AR game. It is a simple basketball game with 2 game modes.

As I said, you have 2 game modes:

## 1. Time Challenge. You have only 60 seconds to get ball into the basket:

To get the basket you should point your phone at a vertikal surface and tap on the red plane on the screen.

You have to use swipe on the screen to setup the power of the shot. The power of the throw is displayed at the bottom of the screen.

In the left corner of the screen you may see the score (how many balls were scored)
In the right corner is countdown time. When the time counter goes to zero, you'll see your score.

##2. Workout Challenge. You have only 10 attempts to get the highest score.
